Hi there, I am Dr. Shrishail Gajbhar. Thanks for visiting my Tech(B)log, a technical log of my learning explorations. As a researcher, I am trying to comprehend the secrets of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focussing on its Image Processing (IP), Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) aspects. 

I have started this blog as a personal logbook to retrospect what I have learned.
